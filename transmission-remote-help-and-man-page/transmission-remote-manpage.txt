DESCRIPTION
     transmission-remote is a remote control utility for transmission(1) and transmission-daemon(1).

     By default, transmission-remote connects to the transmission session at localhost:9091.  Other sessions can be controlled by specifying a different host and/or port.

OPTIONS
     -a --add filenames-or-URLs
             Add torrents to transmission.

     -b --debug
             Enable debugging mode.

     -AS --no-alt-speed
             Don't use the alternate Limits.

     -asd --alt-speed-downlimit limit
             Limit the alternate download speed to limit kilobytes per second.

     -asu --alt-speed-uplimit limit
             Limit the alternate upload speed to limit kilobytes per second.

     -asc --alt-speed-scheduler
             Use the scheduled on/off times.

     -ASC --no-alt-speed-scheduler
             Don't use the scheduled on/off days and times.

     --alt-speed-days days
             Set the number of days on which to enable the speed scheduler, using a list such as "2,4-6".
